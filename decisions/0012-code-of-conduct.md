# Adopt Contributor Code of Conduct

## Context and Problem Statement

As stated in the MPSF [bylaws](https://github.com/materialsproject/foundation/blob/main/bylaws.md), represented codes are expected to adopt and enforce the [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). This PR serves to formally implement that provision.

## Considered Options

### Reference in README and include a copy in the reposotiry

To put this into practice, MPSF codes will

1. Include a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in the root of the repository that contains the text of the Contributor Covenant. See examples [here](https://github.com/materialsproject/maggma/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [here](https://github.com/materialsproject/atomate2/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2. Include a contact email address (conduct@materialsproject.org) as the contact point in the above file.
3. Include a statement in the README file such as the following:
    > New contributors are welcome, please see our Code of Conduct (with link to the .md file).
