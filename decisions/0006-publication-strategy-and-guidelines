# Scope of emmet document models

## Context and Problem Statement

Regular publications are important for several reasons, including:
* An additional method to communicate capabilities of codes with the community.
* Career advancement for individual contributors.
* Increased confidence in methods when a publication has been peer-reviewed.
* An additional method to track usage of a code, specifically when that usage has lead to a scientific advance.
* Motivate and incentivize contribution to codes from new contributors.

It is expected that **publication decisions will primarily always be the responsibility of lead developers.** 
However, it might be useful to formalize some guidelines for best practices.

## Decision Drivers

TBD

## Considered Options

### Proposed Guidelines

We could propose a guideline document that includes the following main points:

1. We encourage publication of software papers.
   Publication and organization of a software paper is the responsibility of the lead developer(s) of that
   software package. The following are guidelines only.
2. A paper should be written or planned by the time an open-source code is used either in published scientific
   research or used on the production Materials Project website.
3. A distinction can be made between more focused codes (e.g., a single feature, unlikely to see extensive
   future development) and more foundational codes (e.g., expects lots of future development or contains a
   new scientific formalism). The former might be more appropriate for a brief paper in a journal such as JOSS.
4. To acknowledge that the initial set of authors will inevitably be incomplete over the lifetime of the code,
   two strategies are suggested:
   a. A Zenodo citation that is continuously updated with all contributors.
   b. "Update" papers, on a frequency that is best determined by the circumstances of an individual code.
5. Paper authorship should be as inclusive as possible, recognizing contributions of not just new features,
   but significant bug fixes, documentation improvements, and other meaningful effort. No contributions should
   be taken for granted.
