# Improving Participation and Representation

## Context and Problem Statement

The Materials Project open-source ecosystem should be a welcoming, inclusive 
environment for new contributors. This requires an active effort, including 
decisions on concrete actions that can be taken to improve participation and 
representation.

## Decision drivers

1. Merging one's first PR is often intimidating to newcomers, and thus becomes an obstacle to growing the developer base, particularly among less-represented groups.
2. MP Staff and external PI's have limited bandwidth for ongoing maintenance and need to expand the development community to share the load.
For first time contributors, working on issues flagged a certain way, we'll provide 1:1 mentoring to get the PR merged
Eventually will provide networking and prof dev opportunity for postdocs / grad students

## Considered Options

1. Formal or informal surveys to talk to people who may want to contribute and have not. This could be done at a large materials science conference, and could include co-ordination with the conference organizers for a more holistic discussion on open-source participation.
2. Encourage community leaders to attend courses provided by the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement.
3. The GitHub Actions for statistics on issues, pull requests and discussions could be installed in all repos. Time to first response is a commonly-quoted metric for determining if a contributor is likely to continuing staying involved.
4. Provide additional training and documentation for new contributors.
4a. Specifically - provide focused mentoring for first time contributors who are working on their first PR, in the form of 1:1 consultations or office hours.

Options 4 and 4a are appealing, but we must recognize that most MP Staff or external PIs lack the time to do this. To mitigate the concern, if first time developers
are willing to work on _pre-existing issues identified by maintainers that they themselves simply don't have time to work on_, then offering our time to
mentor is more feasible.


## Decision Outcome

We propose to implement a PR mentoring program in supported code repositories. Specifically this will comprise

1. Flagging certain GitHub issues with the label "Mentoring Available" indicating it is a priority for the maintainer for MPSF
2. If a contributor wants to tackle such an issue and is making their first contribution to that particular repository, we will offer 1:1, offline mentoring on request. This option can be indicated in the Issue description.
3. The mentoring can be carried out asynchronously via email or live via Zoom office hours, by maintainers, PIs, or grad students / postdocs with appropriate skills.

The PR Mentoring program will thus provide networking and skill building for new contributors, networking and mentoring pracice for grad students/postdocs, and help expand the developer community.
