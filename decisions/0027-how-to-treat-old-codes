# {short title of solved problem and solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

Some codes in the context of the Materials Project have only been developed based on short-term funding, and long-term support is hard/impossible to guarantee.
This code might still be used in the community. One of the recent example codes is Matminer that triggered the discussion.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* These codes are still useful to the community
* There will likely not be any long-term funding for such codes

## Considered Options

### Pin to specific versions of the dependencies and then release a final version
* Good as the code can still be used 
* Bad as it might not be easy to use together with other software
### Transfer code ownership to a fork outside of MP (if someone wants to take over code)
* Good as the code  will still  be  maintained
### Give maintaining  rights to people outside of MP
* Good as more people  can merge and contribute
* Not clear  how such a decision can be made
### Ask on the repo if  someone  might want to take over
* Good as someone else  might  maintain the code  in the future
* Connected with transferring code ownership to someone else

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.
