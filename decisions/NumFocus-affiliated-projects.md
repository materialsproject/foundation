# Apply for affiliated-projects within NumFocus 

## Context and Problem Statement
Being part of NumFocus has a few advantages: 1) financial support 2) increased exposure in the community 3) being part of a wider ecosystem.

We can use the small development grant to run workshops. 

## Considered Options

### Apply collectively as MP or individually for each library 
We agree it's better to apply collectively for the reasons below: 
1) users generally use MP codes as a whole
2) it requires less sustained application efforts 
3) there are precedence where a collection of codes is an affiliated project and apply for seperate funding for individual development effort 

### Interests in participation from individual libraries  
We tentatively assume all MP codes are included unless maintainers of specific libraries want to opt out. 

## Decision Outcome



## Implementation Plan
- @yang-ruoxi will inquire NumFocus about their guidelines
- Once hear back, a subcomittee of interested parties can draft an application before Jan 15 2025
