# Updating the MP parameter sets

## Context and Problem Statement

The last systematic audits of parameters used in the Materials Project workflows occurred in 2011 for PBE, and in 2020-2021 for r$^2$SCAN. Over those years, various parameters in those workflows have been updated as need arose.

This work aims to systematically update a few critical parameters used in the workflows that need updating: `ISMEAR`, `LREAL`,  `LMAXMIX`, `KSPACING`, and `POTCARs`.

[Link to relevant issue with early discussion.](https://github.com/materialsproject/foundation/issues/25).

This document is a summary of a longer document which includes, for each parameter recommendation, a background and motivation section which explains physically what a parameter controls. These sections can safely be skipped if one is already familiar with the parameter. The method and discussion sections present all required descriptions of how tests were conceived, executed, and interpreted.

At present, this [longer document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUUx0wrrtMRcSss5yv3NiQuC7J5IiEKL/view?usp=sharing) is a living document. After a community discussion and foundation vote, it will be frozen with a specific set of recommended parameter changes.

## Decision Drivers

* MP is a global leader in data reliability; periodically updating our computational parameters ensures consistent data quality.

## Considered Options

### Current data-driven recommendation

For INCAR settings:

-   `ALGO` = "NORMAL", as this is robust enough and "ALL" can be quite slow.

-   For relaxations in any solid, `ISMEAR`= 0 (Gaussian smearing) with
    smearing width (SIGMA) 0.05 eV

-   For statics in any solid, `ISMEAR`= -5 (unchanged from prior works)

-   LMAXMIX = 6 in all solids and for plain DFT without Hubbard $U$

-   LREAL = False always

-   Bringing the PBE workflow parameters (ENCUT, EDIFF, EDIFFG, etc.) in
    line with the r$^2$SCAN workflow

For KPOINTS updates: Use $\Gamma$-centered meshes with the following
formula for KSPACING, based on bandgap $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathrm{KSPACING} &= \frac{1}{2} \left\{ \Delta k_\text{min} + \Delta k_\text{max} + (\Delta k_\text{max} - \Delta k_\text{min})\frac{\delta}{[1 + \delta^c]^{1/c}} \right\}, \\
    \delta &= a(E_g - b), \\
    \Delta k_\text{min} &= 0.2, \\
    \Delta k_\text{max} &= 0.45, \\
    a &= 0.9,\\
    b &= 2.35,\\
    c &= 8. \\
\end{aligned}$$

For POTCAR updates:

-   The current actinide series of POTCARs used by MP is inconsistent
    with all-electron data and must be updated.

-   "Optimal" POTCARs are determined by minimizing the error in
    equation-of-state-fitted equilibrium volumes, bulk moduli, and the
    pressure derivative of the bulk modulus. Reference values are taken
    from all-electron data [@bosoni2024]

-   By this criteria, 58 POTCARs in total would be updated

-   Alternately, updating only those 12 elements which show $\geq 3$%
    MAPE in equilibrium volumes yields very comparable accuracy to the
    fully optimized set. This is the "minimal update" set

-   Recommendations for new POTCARs are given in Ref. [@bosoni2024],
    which results in GW-derived pseudopotentials being recommended for
    Ba and Xe, among other elements We have also benchmarked these for
    higher accuracy, and present them in Table
    [\[tab:potcar_changes\]](#tab:potcar_changes){reference-type="ref"
    reference="tab:potcar_changes"}

-   From Table
    [\[tab:potcar_changes\]](#tab:potcar_changes){reference-type="ref"
    reference="tab:potcar_changes"}: going from MP's current POTCAR set
    to the minimal update set reduces the volume MAPE from 2.2% to 0.7%;
    going to the optimal set reduces this further to 0.5%. Similarly,
    for the bulk modulus, going from MP's set to the minimal update set
    reduces the bulk modulus MAPE from 10.7% to 4.0%, and then to 3.9%
    for the optimal set.

For Hubbard $U$ updates:

-   PBE+$U$ is demonstrably worse for describing formation enthalpies

-   An attempt to determine optimal $U$'s for PBE (and later r$^2$SCAN)
    using experimental formation enthalpies for the whole $d$-block was
    unsuccessful

-   Fitting redox enthalpies may represent one path to expanding the
    $U$'s used by MP

We do not present data for PBE$+U$, as this may go into a separate
publication (this can be shared privately).

## Decision Outcome

N/A right now.

## Implementation Plan

The updated parameters currently in [this fork of atomate2](https://github.com/esoteric-ephemera/atomate2/tree/updated_mp), but will be migrated to a pymatgen PR pending a change in atomate2 to move input sets there. (Hence the `~`)

- [~] `pymatgen`: ...
- [~] `atomate2`: ...
- [N/A] `emmet`: ...
- [N/A] `crystal-toolkit`: ...
- [N/A] `jobflow`: ...
- [N/A] `maggma`: ...
